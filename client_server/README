A client-server application where the server can respond to a number of clients.

Server tasks:
The server accepts 2 command line arguments: the max number of clients that it can respond to, and the number of seconds for the timeout timer.
Then the server waits for request for up to the max number of clients:
For each request, the server creates a thread to respond to the client. 
If the number of clients < the max number of clients, then the extra listening socket times out when the number of seconds on the timer is up.
For each client, the server accepts a command to produce an output data set with a numpy function.

Client tasks:
Prompt the user with a menu to run 2 math functions: power function and sine function, or to quit
If the user chooses the power function, prompt for the exponent, min x value, and max x value
If the user chooses the sine function, prompt for the frequency
Send all user input to the server
Receives a data set from the server
Plot the data set with matplotlib
When the user closes the plot, loop back to prompt the user again
End with the user chooses to quit.
